# IMAGE-BASED-CROP-AND-WEED-SPECIES-CLASSIFICATION-AND-DETECTION-
The major objective of the project are: 1)To compare different image segmentation methods and find the best image segmentation method for Maize, Okra, Peanut, Cotton, Bengalgram, Sorghum crop species and Bermudagrass, Velvetleaf, Parthenium and Chrozophora weed images    2)To categorize multiple crop and weed species using Neural network classification approaches, and to access the performance metrics   3)To test the YOLOv8-based computer vision model for real time crop and weed species detection
